# (OUTDATED) Honeypot checker

My first version of a honeypot checker. It scans the source code of a cryptocurrency's contract address, and checks if it looks like the most common honeypot source codes
at the time. This is what I used in 2021 before I purchased any cryptocurrency that was on the BSC Blockchain.
It also contains a basic hardware license check in the SQL Database.
